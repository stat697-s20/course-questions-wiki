# Recipes Exploration Results



```SAS


* Recipe: fizz-buzz.sas ;

* original recipe;
data _null_;
    do i = 1 to 100;
        if mod(i,3) = 0 then put 'Fizz';
        else if mod(i, 5) = 0 then put 'Buzz';
        else put i=;
    end;
run;

* modified to use macro variables to parametrize what's printed when;
* note the need to switch to double-quote for macro variables to render;
* modified to complete the full requirement of FizzBuzz;
%let mod1 = 3;
%let mod1msg = Fizz;
%let mod2 = 5;
%let mod2msg = Buzz;
%let mod3 = 15;
%let mod3msg = Fizzbuzz;
data _null_;
    do i = 1 to 100;
        if mod(i,&mod3) = 0 then put "&mod3msg.";
            else if mod(i,&mod1) = 0 then put "&mod1msg.";
            else if mod(i,&mod2) = 0 then put "&mod2msg.";
        else put i=;
    end;
run;



```



```Python

# Recipe: fizz-buzz.py

# original recipe
for i in range(1,101):
    if i % 3 == 0: print('Fizz')
    elif i % 5 == 0: print('Buzz')
    else: print('i=',i)

# modified to fully solve complete Fizz Buzz problem described at
# https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/
# modified with using global variables for easier editing in the future
mod1 = 15
mod1msg = 'Fizzbuzz'
mod2 = 3
mod2msg = 'Fizz'
mod3 = 5
mod3msg = 'Buzz'
for i in range(1,101):
    if i % mod1 == 0: print(mod1msg)
    elif i % mod2 == 0: print(mod2msg)
    elif i % mod3 == 0: print(mod3msg)
    else: print('i=',i)
